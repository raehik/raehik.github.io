Back in 2018, Alexis King wrote an incredibly handy blog post titled [An
opinionated guide to Haskell in 2018][lexi-lambda-blog-2018-haskell-guide]. The
section on language extensions especially is detailed and discusses rationales
for sets of extensions. A year ago I started writing lots of Haskell, and used
her suggestions as a basis for my defaults. Since I tend to write Cursed and Bad
Code, I ended up bloating my default extensions to a recent maximum of 32.

As we come to the end of 2022, thanks to a recent [stack][] update, the
[`GHC2021`][] language set is finally convenient for all to use. Here I comment
on how and why you should use it, and some other handy extensions to know about.

# Background
The Haskell language is de facto defined by whatever the most popular compiler
GHC permits. However, it's also a standard, which GHC continues to respect. The
extensive research and community effort poured into GHC over the decades have
resulted in better abstractions, extended syntax and adjusted language
semantics. Many of these features are locked behind *language extensions*,
enabled either per-file or globally for a project.

There are a lot of these extensions. Some are deprecated
([`DatatypeContexts`][]), others implied by common extensions
([`ExplicitForAll`][]) others considered unusual style and rarely seen
([`ImplicitParams`][]). But some enable seemingly rather basic features, like
[`MultiParamTypeClasses`][] and [`GADTs`][]. Perhaps you use [`DataKinds`][]
everywhere and are tired of typing out the `LANGUAGE` pragma. (I do, I am.)

Default extension lists enable stating with clarity "this is the Haskell flavour
we're using". But really, most people are using the same base with a few extras
swapping in and out for taste. The GHC developers recognized this, and in GHC
9.2 introduced a "language set" [`GHC2021`][] comprising a good chunk of the
common safe extensions. Now my default set is down to just 10!

# The `GHC2021` language set
## Using `GHC2021`
If you're using Cabal, this has been easy for a long time. In your `library` or
`test-suite` stanza or wherever, add `default-language: GHC2021`. For example:

```
library
  exposed-modules:
      # ...
  # ...
  default-language: GHC2021
```

Stack users can now benefit from this in a similar way. To use `GHC2021` as the
default language set for *every* part of your package (library, executable,
tests), add `language: GHC2021` to the top level of your `package.yaml`.
Example:

```yaml
name: my-package
# ...
language: GHC2021
```

## What `GHC2021` means for your project
The user's guide page documents which extensions the flag enables. Allow me to
comment briefly on what it all means for semantics and permitted syntax. I've
selected the extensions I feel are most important, and grouped them according to
their role. For a full list of extensions enabled by `GHC2021`, see the [user's
guide page][GHC2021].

#### Adds missing syntax
The Haskell standard omits some important syntax. This stuff should be in
Haskell, end of.

  * [`EmptyCase`][]: `\case {}`
  * [`EmptyDataDecls`][]: `data Void`
  * [`BangPatterns`][]: programmer strictness annotations

These too, but they're less integral.

  * [`TupleSections`][]: more tuple syntax (which I personally don't use)
  * [`ImportQualifiedPost`][]: cleaner import syntax

#### Makes type classes a bit more sensible
Type classes have evolved a lot over GHC's lifetime. `GHC2021` thankfully
enables the ones you need to have a good time.

  * [`MultiParamTypeClasses`][]: or no `MonadReader r m` for you!
  * [`FlexibleInstances`][], [`FlexibleContexts`][]: relax silly rules

#### Fleshes out kind system
Through extensive changes to Haskell's kind system, GHC gives programmers
extremely powerful tools. Most of the big players are provided by `GHC2021`. The
syntax additions are small/ingrained enough into the existing language that
reading them shouldn't cause much distress to unaccustomed programmers.

  * [`PolyKinds`][]
  * [`ConstraintKinds`][]
  * [`StandaloneKindSignatures`][]

#### Powers up type system
These are larger changes to the language which are likely to surprise new users.
They are focused around the explicit quantification and scoping of type
variables, and the `forall` construct. [`TypeApplications`][] in particular adds
an extra dimension to function calls.

  * [`RankNTypes`][]
  * [`ScopedTypeVariables`][]
  * [`TypeApplications`][]

#### Extends deriving mechanism
GHC can derive efficient type class instances for many type classes. `GHC2021`
enables them all. They do nothing if you don't request GHC derive such an
instance. The user's guide page
[Deriving instances of extra classes (`Data`, etc.)](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/deriving_extra)
and its sibling pages are useful for further reading.

  * [`DeriveDataTypeable`][]
  * [`DeriveFoldable`][]
  * [`DeriveFunctor`][]
  * [`DeriveGeneric`][]
  * [`DeriveLift`][]
  * [`DeriveTraversable`][]

[`StandaloneDeriving`][] is also enabled, which provides more flexible syntax
for deriving weirder types.

# Other extensions I always use
## [`DerivingStrategies`][]
An essential instance derivation extension that barely missed out on `GHC2021`
inclusion. GHC now has a few ways to derive instances:

  * via [`DeriveAnyClass`][], generate instance with no explicit definitions
    (useful with [`DefaultSignatures`][] to provide a "default" instance)
  * via [`DerivingVia`][], generate instance through a coercible type which
    already has an instance (to use with `newtype`s)
  * via standard mechanisms built into the compiler for certain type classes:
    `Eq`, `Ord`, `Functor` with [`DeriveFunctor`][], ...

The compiler decides on the method to use. The heuristic is pretty
straightforward... but also totally hidden from the user. And judging from
recent innovation, the deriving mechanism may well continue to evolve.

[`DerivingStrategies`][] permits the user to specify which derivation method to
use:

```haskell
data Tree a = Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) | Leaf
    deriving stock (Eq, Ord)

newtype BTree a = BTree (Tree a)
    deriving (Eq, Ord) via (Tree a)
```

Explicitness is always good. I make a point of using `deriving stock`
everywhere.

## [`DerivingVia`][]
Mentioned above, this is another deriving extension. It generalizes
[`GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving`][] (lol), which is another way of saying you
should always use `DerivingVia` in its place. See the documentation for details.

`DerivingVia` actually implies `DerivingStrategies`, but while both remain
uncommon to see in Haskell code, I like to point them out separately.

## [`LambdaCase`][]
How'd this slip through the cracks? It adds a key piece of syntax:

```haskell
intToBool :: Int -> Bool
intToBool = \case 1 -> True
                  _ -> False
```

The only pointfree style that you can't disagree with. Keep him in your hearts,
and your `default-extensions`.

## [`NoStarIsType`][]
[ghc-proposal-0143-remove-star-kind]: https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0143-remove-star-kind.rst
[justin-kuritzkes-perfect-world]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl3H4vMqYNo

Haskell originally used `*` to denote the kind of a type, like `Int :: *`. As
the GHC folks began to muddy the line between terms and types, it's gotten
painful to support this syntax decision. Behind the scenes, the kind of a type
has been `Type` for a while... but a default extension `StarIsType` re-enables
the old syntax for compatibility. So folks who like to multiply type-level
naturals have to fumble around with imports and language extensions.

In a perfect world, extensions like this would not exist.
But [this is not a perfect world][justin-kuritzkes-perfect-world].
Take comfort in the knowledge that some day, `NoStarIsType` will be the default.
Though, um, [one of the GHC proposals][ghc-proposal-0143-remove-star-kind]
concerning it gives a 7-year deprecation schedule. Oh.

## Larger jumps
I like to enable these extensions by default, but I understand why they might be
controversial. Firstly, ones I hope to see in the next `GHC202X`:

  * [`GADTs`][]: surely we're used to these by now!
  * [`RoleAnnotations`][]: extra syntax required for some libraries, safe
  * [`DefaultSignatures`][]: type class extension, very often handy

And the ones I appreciate are personal decisions:

  * [`TypeFamilies`][]: I love 'em, but they're still relatively new
  * [`DataKinds`][]: lovely but the syntax is not self-explanatory
  * [`MagicHash`][]: for the `GHC.Exts` enjoyers out there -- honestly not a big
    jump from tick prefix notation

# Extensions to enable on-demand
## [`UndecidableInstances`][]
The idea of embracing undecidability tends to put people off, but don't be
afraid of her! This is required for much type class wizardry, in the cases where
GHC's heuristics can't guarantee instance resolution will terminate. It doesn't
impact runtime behaviour, but those restrictions keep you on the straight and
narrow, writing sensible code.

Enable only for files where compilation fails and GHC says you need
`UndecidableInstances` *and* you were expecting that to happen.

## [`AllowAmbiguousTypes`][]
This often goes hand in hand with [`TypeApplications`][]-heavy code. It
indicates a distinct function design, that certain functions can't be used
without an explicit type application, which is unusual to most Haskell
developers.

Similar to `UndecidableInstances`, enable this only when GHC tells you to.

## [`StarIsType`][]
As described above, if you enable [`NoStarIsType`][] by default, you may need
this on occasion to work with modules using the old `Int :: *` style.

## [`ApplicativeDo`][]
[Monad of no return]: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/proposal/monad-of-no-return

A fantastic extension that shines in the infrequent, yet surprisingly real-world
cases where you have some `f :: Type -> Type` which has an `Applicative`
instance, but no lawful `Monad` instance.

According to [Alexis King's 2018 post][lexi-lambda-blog-2018-haskell-guide], it
won't always work, might mess with "buggy" `Applicative`/`Monad` instances that
don't follow best practices (which should be mostly resolved by the [Monad of no
return][] proposal, in the... far future), and hides a hefty amount of
implementation complexity. I've only used it recently, and went with per-module.
Up to you.

## [`CPP`][], [`TemplateHaskell`][]
These are massive, scary extensions that do a lot, and you should only enable
one when you have a specific need for it.

# Special mentions
These extensions I don't personally use as defaults, but are useful or worth
considering.

  * [`OverloadedStrings`][]: can force extra type annotations, prefer per-module
  * [`FunctionalDependencies`][]: remains useful, though associated types via
    [`TypeFamilies`][] often work better
  * [`PatternSynonyms`][]: amazing but huge, and without enabling you can still
    use (just not define), so per-module is sensible

# Wrap-up
`GHC2021` is good to use. It communicates to fellow authors some base
expectations they should have about the project's syntax. I hope this post may
illuminate some of more important additions to know about.
